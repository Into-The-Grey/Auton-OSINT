## 🤞 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Auton-OSINT:

   contact: [REDACTED]
   subject: [SECURITY] Auton-OSINT Vulnerability Report
   ```

3. Please include:
   - A description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce (if known)
   - Proof-of-concept (if available)
   - Potential impact

You’ll receive a response within **72 hours**, and we’ll coordinate a safe resolution timeline.
